            <h2>Game Developing</h2>
            <h3>2020-Present | Pro Level Developer</h3>
            <p>Game Development, or gamedev, involves creating video games. It can be done by a single person or a global team. Commercial PC and console games, funded by publishers, often take years to complete. Indie games, on the other hand, are quicker and more affordable, often created by individuals or small teams. The indie game industry is growing, thanks to accessible development tools like Unity and Unreal Engine, along with online distribution platforms like Steam and Uplay, and the mobile game market on Android and iOS.</p>
